# Statistical Analysis and Linear Regression Project

## Description
This project involves statistical analysis and linear regression using a dataset that explores relationships between variables. The analysis provides insights into key statistical parameters, correlations, and predictive modeling through linear regression.

## Included Files
- **progetto 3.xlsx:** Excel file containing all datasets and analysis.

## Objectives
- Perform statistical analysis to estimate parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals.  
- Analyze relationships between variables through correlation coefficients.  
- Apply linear regression to model data and make predictions.

## Features
- **Statistical Insights:** Calculation of key metrics like expected values, confidence intervals, and standard deviation.  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore the strength and direction of relationships between variables.  
- **Linear Regression:** Predict outcomes and understand relationships between independent and dependent variables.

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualization.
